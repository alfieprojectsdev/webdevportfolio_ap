# webdevportfolio_ap - 🚧 Personal Projects (In Progress / Actively Maintained)

Welcome to my dev sandbox — a mix of real-world problem solving, family needs, and niche opportunities. Some projects are serious, some are scrappy, but all are hands-on learning experiences with practical goals.

## 🕵️‍♂️ JobHunter CLI

**Stack**: Python (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas)

**What it is**: A command-line tool that scrapes company metadata and job postings from the open-source [`remoteintech/remote-jobs`](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs) repository.

**Why**: To automate my own job search while also demonstrating scraping, crawling, and data automation skills in a clean portfolio-ready project.

**Features**:
- `scrape-metadata`: Extracts company names, websites, regions, remote status, and careers URLs into `companies.csv`.
- `crawl-jobs`: Visits each careers page and scrapes job postings into `jobs.csv`.
- Built for **local repo clones** (no ToS scraping issues).
- Outputs structured CSV data for easy analysis or integration.

**Status**: [Actively maintained](https://github.com/alfieprojectsdev/jobhunter), with plans to extend into ATS-specific crawlers (Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, etc.) and database-backed storage.

## 🚗 Condo Parking Booking App

**Stack**: Next.js + Supabase

**What it is**: A booking system for residents to list and reserve condo parking slots with flexible time windows.

**Why**: Inspired by real condo group chat behavior — lots of back-and-forth for temporary slots. This app formalizes that flow.

**Features**:
- Custom availability windows
- Booking and slot listing
- (Coming soon) Calendar view and in-app messaging

**Status**: [Actively developed](https://github.com/alfieprojectsdev/parkingbooker), serving as my main portfolio project for learning full-stack web dev.

## 🔬 Lab Services Marketplace

**What it is**: A web platform to help connect clients with science labs offering testing, analysis, or instrumentation services.

**Why**: Supporting my chemist sister’s startup idea. We're exploiting a niche — labs want more clients, clients want to find legit labs. Nobody’s doing this properly yet.

**Reality check**: This isn’t a flashy startup pitch. Just filling a market gap with practical tech.

**Status**: In planning/[prototyping stage](https://github.com/alfieprojectsdev/pipetgo-mockup). Focus is on building a lean MVP.

## ➕ Math Operations Window Card Generator

**What it is**: A printable worksheet generator for multi-digit addition/subtraction/multiplication/division problems — optimized for SPED and early grade school use.

**Why**: One of my kid’s teachers required window cards for the students. Buying fixed sets at bookstores wasn’t cost-effective. If there's a printer in school, why not generate custom ones?

**Features**:
- 4- to 6-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems
- Adjustable font sizes (10x10 grid on A4 paper)
- Visual separator between addends and answer line

**Bonus**: Makes a decent case for budgeting a printer — even for underfunded schools. A single A4 sheet can serve up multiple problems per session, tailored to the day’s lesson. Print only what’s needed, when it’s needed — no waste, no bulk orders.

**Status**: [Fully working](https://alfieprojectsdev.github.io/windowcards/) and in classroom use. Ongoing updates based on teacher feedback.

## 🛠️ More to come…

These are the current builds on my workbench. Each one reflects a small piece of daily life — whether at home, at school, or in a niche science field. I'm always improving things based on real-world use and feedback.
